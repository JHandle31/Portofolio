# My Portofolio
All the projects you can see in this portofolio are made in my free time

### Some problems
These are solutions to some problems that i found online

### Movie website
I wanted to make a website where one can look up movies and get some additional information about the website.
This project used the following languages: _**PHP, CSS, HTML, JS(Javascript) + jQuery**_
I had scraped all the picuters and information for this website via python webscraper. First I only used _**BeautifulSoup**_ but this was going slow so I decided to use _**Scrapy**_ which took some time getting used to, but in the end it was really useful to learn. 

A couple of screenshots of the movie website
